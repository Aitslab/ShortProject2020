Steps for running buildHGNC.py and buildUniprot.py:¶
	1	Add #!/usr/bin/env python3 line to each of the scripts and to protein.py (class).
	2	Put all the scripts in the same directory a long with the downloaded databases.
	3	chmod the scripts (except protein.py because it's a class so no need to run it) and run them.
  
  
**Steps for accessing Marcus's server**:¶
	1	Clone BioNLP repository to the computer. (git clone)
	2	Go to marcus> dictionarytagger > mention-index-py4j.
	3	Run inside the repo: "git submodule update --init --recursive" because dicoria is a submodule and needs to be fetched from its source repo.
	4	run ./gradlew build.
	5	run ./gradlew run. (now I am inside the server)
	6	open another terminal to run buidlDict.py.

**Emil and Petter's code**:
-I contacted Emil and Petter because the code was throwing a mentionindex error. It turned out that there's no need to keep mentionindex lines in the code. 
-Have hgnc.out and uniprot.out together with buildDict.py in the same directory.
-buildDict.py was modified to get columns about HGNC symbol, uniprot ID, protein names+synonyms, and LUGE ID (which includes the taxonomic ID). It had originally the LUGE_ID and the protein name only. SAVED AS buildDict2.py 
-Output generated is called 'index.txt'. I renamed to ‘Full_HU_table’.
-A python scripts named "Separate_Synonyms_HU" should be used along with the bash commands to get the synonyms in a separate column.
